Hi, my name is Tan!

I'm an international student from Canada working towards my Master's of Science in Statistics and Data Science at the University of Texas at Dallas.

You can often find me rock climbing, playing badminton, learning to dance, or reading a book.

One thing that changed my life was joining Toastmasters, a public speaking club.

After graduating, I plan on launching a career as a data scientist.
